# SpanishFlashCard

This project is coded with another developer for a Swift course from graduate school. 

Project description:

Our application will feature a flashcard in Spanish meant for individuals ages 5+. The
goal of this application is to help individuals quickly learn Spanish and identify basic
Spanish nouns. We assume that the users would know little Spanish and are on a
rudimentary level.

There will be 20 total flashcards. Each flashcard screen will have a question, a
picture, 3 answer options, correct answer display box, and next question button.
While navigating through the application, the user will be presented with basic
Spanish nouns written in English paired with a visual. We believe that it is important
to pair all of our words with a visual to aid learning the vocabulary, especially if the
user decides to come back and go through the flashcard again. On each screen, the
user will be given at least 3 options in Spanish to be selected as a matching word to
the visual.

There is a counter that will keep track of the user’s collection of correct responses.
The last screen will show users his/her overall score and an option to restart the quiz.
Application Features &amp; Functions:

1) The application has an introductory page whenever the user opens the application.
The page will look like below and it will feature a “Start” button to begin the quiz.

2) The application will start with a Spanish vocabulary quiz. 

3) There will be 20 total cards in the application. The user will select the correct
answer from the options. The white box on the bottom will indicate if the user has
pressed the correct or incorrect answer.
Click “Next” to view the next question. This screen format will reappear until the
users has exhausted all of the questions in the quiz.

4) After the user has gone through all 20 cards, the results page will appear showing
the number of correct vs incorrect responses when the user presses “Show Score”.
The user will also have an option to swift left to “Retry” the quiz again. This will
take the user to the first flash card quiz question. If the user wants to exit the
application, then swift right for “Exit”.
